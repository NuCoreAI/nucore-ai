[
{ "device_id": "<DEVICE_ID>", "command_id": "<COMMAND_ID>", "command_params": [ { "id": "<PARAM_ID>", "value": <VALUE>, "uom": "<UOM_ID>" }, { <additional param if any> }, ...  ] },
{ <more commands if any> },
....
]
__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__

---

2. By querying current and live property values and statuses
__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__
[
{ "device_id": "<DEVICE_ID>", "property_id": "<PROPERTY_ID>", "property_name": "<PROPERTY_NAME>" },
{ <more properties if any },
....
]
__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__

---
3. By creating one or more NuCore routines

__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__
[
{
  "routine": {
    "id": <int>,
    "name": "<descriptive name>",
    "parent": 0,
    "comment": "<optional>",
    "if": [ /* ordered flat Condition Tokens */ ],
    "then": [ /* actions */ ],
    "else": [ /* actions */ ],
    "reasoning": "<assistant's reasoning for the structure and semantics of this routine>" 
  }
